											<h3>Mason's points</h3>
										</header>
										<div class="content">

											<p>Although this novel is classified as science fiction, I think it is more like a fantasy adventure story. I think the biggest difference between me and this novel is how to grow up from the incident and learn to be independent. From childhood to adulthood, I was like a flower in a greenhouse, unable to get out of the comfort zone of life. Due to my lack of courage to try different things and my indecisive personality, I often miss many precious opportunities. Meg, on the other hand, is about the age of a high school student, willing to embark on an unknown journey to save her family. Although she was terrified, in the end she succeeded. I feel that if life is not full of challenges, then life will be meaningless.</p>

											<p>I think Bod and I share some similarities due to family factors. I rarely have the opportunity to venture outside, such as traveling abroad, and my daily life revolves around family and school. However, I know that I am someone who enjoys trying new things, appreciating, and witnessing. As I grow older, I am gradually becoming more independent and realizing that it is time to step out of my comfort zone.<p>

										<h3>Bryce's points</h3>
										</header>
										<div class="content">
											<p>I am a person who enjoys urban tales very much. When I read this section, I could clearly see the emotion expressed by the two bullies. At that time, I recalled a plot from the best urban tale called “The Mandela Catalogue”, which tells the story of demons disguised as humans who look almost the same as someone you are familiar with, but with some indistinguishable features. One of the famous stories in this small series tells of two young men who received a call asking them to exorcise a spirit of a lady’s cat and persuaded them to check it out in person. Unfortunately, one of them died during the exploration and was replaced by a demon, which they called “an alternative” in the story. The one who lived died from mind control manipulation by the alternative and probably became an alternative himself in the end.<p>

											<h3>Frost's points</h3>
										</header>
										<div class="content">
											<p>I think I look like Meg when I was in high school. Pretend to be cool and mature, but the truth is I am sensitive and emotional. Fearing to try new thing and believe others, only do something that I think it is logical. After the adventure, Meg recognized how precious everything she had, the daily life with her family and friends. I also realize how fortunate I am until I left home. Just like the quote said, “Maybe if you aren’t unhappy sometimes you don’t know how to be happy.”<p>

											<h3>Quotes and personal thoughts from The Graveyard book</h3>
										</header>
										<div class="content">

											<blockquote>“You're still alive, Bod, which means you've got a lot of potential. You can do anything, create anything, dream anything.” P.256
The first quote is very interesting. The dream of many people in childhood is to live a happy life when they grow up. But how many adults live in accordance with their childhood wishes? In this turbulent society, it is very difficult for many people to find a little quiet. Work pressure, interpersonal relationship and even family problems, many people have to worry about their own life and to take charge of their future. Just like Bod, if he leaves the graveyard someday, he needs to take care of himself and be responsible for his own life.
 
The quote is very important to me. Bod was forced to stay in the graveyard because he had to escape from the killer, he was very eager to explore the outside world. However, unlike Bod, we don’t seem to have the courage to try new things in reality, because we are worried about failure, scolding, and worrying about everything. As a result, we obviously have many opportunities to achieve things we dare not do, but we only being able to stay in the comfort zone and continue to be a flower in the greenhouse. We only live once, why not be brave enough to try those activities we have never thought of before?- Mason.
<hr>
<p>“See the world”, said Bod. “Get into trouble. Get out of trouble again. Visit jungles and volcanoes and deserts and islands. And people, I want to meet an awful lot of people.”(p306)
 
I believe that one of the most important values of being human is to bear witness. To appreciate all kinds of people and things, whether it's nature, humanity, or oneself, and to witness the changes that are happening or have happened with our own eyes. I admire Bod's courage to face and try new things, a trait that is precious and rare, and perhaps it's because his comfort zone is in the graveyard since childhood that he desires to leave and witness the world he has never seen before. But that's a good thing. Because we must continue to learn, whether through action or our senses.- Noah.<p> 
<hr>
<p>You can catch it.  Sometimes all it takes is for someone to say that  
they're scared for the fear to become real." 
(P.188) 

At this section, the two bullies were astonished by the creepy move Bod did. They did not see anything lively but figured out they were trapped in a deep, dark, and spooky churchyard. They recognized something was really wrong, yet the unseen and fearful emotion grew like a seed upon their heart, for what they were able to see has been so doubtful to be aware of. Therefore, fear started to spread. - Bryce.<p>

<hr>
<p>“If you dare nothing, then when the day is over, nothing is all you will have gained.” (Page 102.)  Because this quote came from a dead man who has lived hundreds of years, and he has seen various people’s life. People often regretted for something they did not dare to do, and they are good at finding excuses for themselves. - Frost.<p> </blockquote>

											<h3>Quotes and personal thoughts from A Wrinkle in Time</h3>
										</header>
										<div class="content">

											<blockquote>“The thing which we are seen are temporal. But the things which are not seen are eternal.” P.205
Vision, the window to the human soul, is very important to us. We appreciate beauty and appreciate different people and things. Through these eyes, our lives become so rich. However, the objects we see will one day be destroyed or disappear, and those that we cannot see with the naked eye will remain forever, forever.- Mason.

<hr>
<p>“Love. That was what she had that IT did not have. She had Mrs. Whatis’ love, and her father’s, and her mother’s and the real Charles Wallace’s love, and the twins’, and Aunt Beast’s. And she had her love for them.('A Wrinkle in Time'.)
 
I believe that love is a stronger emotion than despair or hope, even though love can bring both despair and hope. With enough love, one can overcome despair and bring hope. Love can be a driving force, a source of comfort, a healing agent, and it can also be a weapon.- Noah.<p>

<hr>
<p>"I'm scared," Charles said. "I can't reach them at all. I'm completely shut out." 
"We have to find Father-" Meg started again. 
"Meg-" Charles Wallace's eyes were wide and frightened. "I'm... 
Meg's reassurance came quickly. "You'll know him... 
(P.125~P.126) After knowing what the situation was at the moment, the protagonists were doubting about the capabilities they had, while Meg understood nothing could be done without others' help. Words might be more powerful than action, this kind of ideology is also widely to be seen or mentioned in this novel in my opinion. Sometimes we only do need consolation. - Bryce.<p>

<hr>
<p>“Maybe if you aren’t unhappy sometimes you don’t know how to be happy.” (Page 157)                                                  What this quote says happens all the time. People never realize how precious one thing is until the one thing disappear. -Frost.<p></blockquote>
